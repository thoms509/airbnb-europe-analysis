# Airbnb Pricing Analysis Across European Cities

This project uses SQL and Looker Studio to analyze Airbnb listings in 10 major European cities: Amsterdam, Paris, London, Barcelona, Berlin, Vienna, Lisbon, Rome, Budapest, and Athens.

##  Project Overview
The goal is to explore how Airbnb prices vary between weekdays and weekends, and identify key price drivers such as:
- Room type
- Host status (superhost vs. regular)
- Location (distance from city center)
- Guest satisfaction ratings

##  Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL syntax)** for querying and transforming data
- **Looker Studio** for building interactive visualizations and maps
- **Excel** for minor data cleaning and merging files

##  Visualizations
- Average price by city and day type
- Superhost vs. non-superhost pricing
- Price by room type
- Price vs. distance from city center
- Heatmap of listing prices by location
- Guest satisfaction per dollar by city

##  Data
Original dataset from [Kaggle - Airbnb Prices in European Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities), merged into two main CSV files.
- `all_weekday_listings.csv`
- `all_weekend_listings.csv`
