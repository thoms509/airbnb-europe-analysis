# SQL Queries â€” Airbnb Pricing Dashboard

This page contains all SQL queries used to power the visualizations in the Airbnb Pricing Analysis Dashboard. The queries were written using Looker Studio's SQL interface on top of two pre-processed CSV files:

- `all_weekday_listings.csv`
- `all_weekend_listings.csv`

These datasets were created by merging city-level Airbnb data from 10 major European cities: Amsterdam, Paris, London, Barcelona, Berlin, Vienna, Lisbon, Rome, Budapest, and Athens.

## 1. avg_price_by_city_daytype
**Visualization:** Stacked Bar Chart  
**Purpose:** Calculates the average price in each city, split by weekday vs. weekend.

```sql
SELECT city, 'Weekday' AS day_type, ROUND(AVG(realSum), 2) AS avg_price
FROM all_weekday_listings
WHERE realSum > 0
GROUP BY city

UNION ALL

SELECT city, 'Weekend' AS day_type, ROUND(AVG(realSum), 2) AS avg_price
FROM all_weekend_listings
WHERE realSum > 0
GROUP BY city;
```

## 2. price_by_superhost_daytype
**Visualization:** Stacked Bar Chart 
**Purpose:** Compares pricing between Superhosts and regular hosts by day type.

```sql
SELECT host_is_superhost, 'Weekday' AS day_type, ROUND(AVG(realSum), 2) AS avg_price, COUNT(*) AS listing_count
FROM all_weekday_listings
GROUP BY host_is_superhost

UNION ALL

SELECT host_is_superhost, 'Weekend' AS day_type, ROUND(AVG(realSum), 2) AS avg_price, COUNT(*) AS listing_count
FROM all_weekend_listings
GROUP BY host_is_superhost;
```

## 3. avg_price_by_roomtype_daytype
**Visualization:** Grouped Bar Chart  
**Purpose:** Shows average price by room type across weekdays and weekends.

```sql
SELECT room_type, 'Weekday' AS Day_Type, ROUND(AVG(realSum), 2) AS Avg_Price, COUNT(*) AS Listing_Count
FROM all_weekday_listings
GROUP BY room_type

UNION ALL

SELECT room_type, 'Weekend' AS Day_Type, ROUND(AVG(realSum), 2) AS Avg_Price, COUNT(*) AS Listing_Count
FROM all_weekend_listings
GROUP BY room_type;
```

## 4. distance_vs_price_by_daytype
**Visualization:** Scatter Plot  
**Purpose:** Explores the correlation between price and distance from the city center.

```sql
SELECT city, ROUND(dist, 2) AS Distance_km, ROUND(realSum, 2) AS Price, 'Weekday' AS Day_Type
FROM all_weekday_listings
WHERE dist IS NOT NULL AND realSum IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT city, ROUND(dist, 2) AS Distance_km, ROUND(realSum, 2) AS Price, 'Weekend' AS Day_Type
FROM all_weekend_listings
WHERE dist IS NOT NULL AND realSum IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## 5. listing_map_lat_lng_daytype
**Visualization:** Heatmap  
**Purpose:** Displays price distribution geographically using lat/lng coordinates.

```sql
SELECT lat, lng, realSum AS price, city, room_type, 'Weekday' AS day_type
FROM all_weekday_listings
WHERE lat IS NOT NULL AND lng IS NOT NULL AND realSum IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT lat, lng, realSum AS price, city, room_type, 'Weekend' AS day_type
FROM all_weekend_listings
WHERE lat IS NOT NULL AND lng IS NOT NULL AND realSum IS NOT NULL;
```

*Note: Latitude and longitude values were formatted as "latitude,longitude" strings in Excel for map compatibility.*

## 6. satisfaction_per_dollar_by_city_daytype
**Visualization:** Bar Chart  
**Purpose:** Identifies which cities offer the most guest satisfaction per dollar spent.

```sql
SELECT city, ROUND(AVG(guest_satisfaction_overall / realSum), 4) AS satisfaction_per_dollar, COUNT(*) AS listings, 'Weekday' AS day_type
FROM all_weekday_listings
WHERE realSum > 0 AND guest_satisfaction_overall IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50

UNION ALL

SELECT city, ROUND(AVG(guest_satisfaction_overall / realSum), 4) AS satisfaction_per_dollar, COUNT(*) AS listings, 'Weekend' AS day_type
FROM all_weekend_listings
WHERE realSum > 0 AND guest_satisfaction_overall IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50;
```
